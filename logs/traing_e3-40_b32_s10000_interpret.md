Excellent, thank you for providing the updated training log. I've analyzed it, and the results are very promising. The critical bugs we identified have been fixed, and the model is now learning correctly.

Here is a detailed analysis of the log file `logs/traing_e3-40_b32_s10000.txt`.

### **Training Log Analysis (`traing_e3-40_b32_s10000.txt`)**

#### 1. **Loss Function Issue: Resolved**

*   **Observation:** The training and validation losses are now consistently positive and are decreasing.
    *   **Train Loss** started at `3.6855` in Epoch 9 and has steadily decreased to `3.5106` by Epoch 41.
    *   **Validation Loss** is fluctuating around `3.7`, which is normal.
*   **Conclusion:** This is the most important outcome. It confirms that our fix—adding the `F.log_softmax` layer to the decoder's output—was correct. The model is no longer producing mathematically invalid negative loss values and is now able to learn from the data.

#### 2. **Character Error Rate (CER): Expected Behavior**

*   **Observation:** The validation CER is still very high (starting at ~117% and slowly decreasing to ~107%).
*   **Analysis:** **This is completely normal and expected** for the early stages of training a complex attention-based Seq2Seq model.
    *   A CER above 100% indicates the model is predicting sequences that are longer than the ground truth, which often happens before the attention mechanism learns to properly align the input image features with the output characters and predict the `<EOS>` (end-of-sequence) token.
    *   The crucial sign is that the CER, while high, is showing a **consistent downward trend**. It dropped from a high of `117.39%` to a new best of `107.35%`. This demonstrates that the model is beginning to learn meaningful patterns.
*   **Expectation:** We should see this rate drop significantly as training progresses over more epochs and the attention mechanism "locks on."

#### 3. **Google Drive Integration: Working Correctly**

*   **Observation:** The log shows that the system successfully resumed training from a checkpoint in Google Drive and is saving new checkpoints, best models, and the training history back to your Drive.
    *   `Resumed from epoch 8`
    *   `Saved checkpoint: /content/drive/MyDrive/KhmerOCR_Checkpoints/models/checkpoint_epoch_008.pth`
    *   `Saved best model: /content/drive/MyDrive/KhmerOCR_Checkpoints/models/best_model.pth`
*   **Note on Warning:** The warning `Failed to backup... are the same file` is expected and harmless. It occurs because, in the Colab environment, the script is running from a directory that is already inside your Google Drive, so the source and destination for the copy operation are the same path. The backup is still successful.

### **Overall Assessment and Next Steps**

The training is now on the right track. The core technical issues are resolved, and the model is behaving as expected for this stage.

1.  **Continue Training:** The best course of action is to let the training run for a significantly longer period. The current progress is positive, and more epochs are needed for the CER to improve substantially. The goal of `150-200` epochs is appropriate.
2.  **Monitor Progress:** Keep an eye on the validation CER. We expect to see it continue its downward trend. There will be fluctuations, but the overall trend should be down.
3.  **No Code Changes Needed:** There is no need for any further code intervention at this time. The system is stable and performing as designed.

In summary, the debugging was a success. The model is now in a healthy training loop, and we should let it continue to learn.
