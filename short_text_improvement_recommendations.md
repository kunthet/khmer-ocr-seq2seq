# Improving Khmer OCR Performance on Short Texts

## Executive Summary

Based on validation analysis of 6,400 samples, your Khmer OCR model shows a significant performance gap for short texts:

- **Short texts (0-10 chars)**: 15.2% CER, 56.4% sequence accuracy ‚ùå
- **Long texts (100+ chars)**: 0.1% CER, 91.8% sequence accuracy ‚≠ê

This document outlines targeted strategies to improve short text recognition while maintaining excellent performance on longer sequences.

## Current Performance Analysis

### Performance by Text Length
| Length Range | Sample Count | Mean CER | Sequence Accuracy | Performance Gap |
|-------------|--------------|----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| 0-10 chars  | 55          | 15.2%    | 56.4%            | **-35.4%** vs long |
| 11-20 chars | 182         | 1.9%     | 78.6%            | -13.2% vs long |
| 21-50 chars | 440         | 0.6%     | 85.9%            | -5.9% vs long |
| 51-100 chars| 712         | 0.2%     | 90.7%            | -1.1% vs long |
| 100+ chars | 5,011       | 0.1%     | 91.8%            | **Baseline** |

### Root Cause Analysis

**Why Short Texts Perform Poorly:**
1. **Insufficient Context**: Attention mechanisms have less contextual information
2. **Higher Relative Impact**: Single character errors have disproportionate effect on short sequences
3. **Language Model Limitations**: Reduced statistical priors for short sequences
4. **Training Data Imbalance**: Only 0.9% of validation samples are short texts (55/6,400)

## Recommended Improvement Strategies

### üéØ **Strategy 1: Data Augmentation for Short Texts**

#### 1.1 Generate Synthetic Short Texts
```python
# Recommended approach
- Extract short segments from long texts in training data
- Create single-word and short-phrase datasets
- Focus on common Khmer words: ·ûÄ·û∂·ûö, ·ûá·û∂, ·ûì·üÅ·üá, ·ûì·üÑ·üá, etc.
- Target 10,000+ short text samples (vs current ~55)
```

#### 1.2 Specific Short Text Categories
- **Single characters**: Individual Khmer consonants and vowels
- **Common words**: Frequency-based vocabulary (top 1000 Khmer words)
- **Numbers and dates**: ·ü°, ·ü¢, ·ü£, etc.
- **Punctuation combinations**: Various Khmer punctuation marks
- **Names and proper nouns**: Common Khmer names and places

### üîß **Strategy 2: Model Architecture Optimization**

#### 2.1 Length-Aware Training
```python
# Implementation approach
- Implement curriculum learning: start training with longer texts
- Gradually introduce shorter texts as training progresses
- Use weighted loss function: higher weight for short text errors
- Separate validation metrics for different length ranges
```

#### 2.2 Multi-Scale Feature Extraction
```python
# Architecture modifications
- Add separate encoder branch for short sequences
- Implement adaptive attention window sizes
- Use character-level and word-level features simultaneously
- Consider transformer variants optimized for short sequences
```

### üìä **Strategy 3: Training Data Rebalancing**

#### 3.1 Stratified Sampling
- **Current distribution**: 0.9% short texts (problematic)
- **Target distribution**: 15-20% short texts in training batches
- Implement balanced batch sampling by text length
- Use oversampling techniques for short text categories

#### 3.2 Data Collection Priorities
- Collect real-world short text samples (signs, labels, captions)
- Focus on domain-specific short texts (addresses, phone numbers)
- Include degraded/low-quality short text images
- Gather handwritten short text samples

### üõ† **Strategy 4: Technical Implementation**

#### 4.1 Loss Function Modifications
```python
# Weighted loss by sequence length
def length_weighted_loss(predictions, targets, lengths):
    base_loss = ctc_loss(predictions, targets)
    # Higher weight for shorter sequences
    length_weights = torch.exp(-lengths / 20.0)  # Exponential weighting
    return (base_loss * length_weights).mean()
```

#### 4.2 Attention Mechanism Tuning
```python
# Attention modifications for short texts
- Reduce attention dropout for sequences < 10 characters
- Implement position-aware attention scaling
- Add character-level attention alongside word-level
- Use learned positional embeddings optimized for short sequences
```

### üîç **Strategy 5: Post-Processing Enhancement**

#### 5.1 Short Text Validation Rules
```python
# Implement Khmer-specific rules
- Character combination validation (valid subscripts/superscripts)
- Common word dictionary lookup
- Phonetic consistency checks
- Length-appropriate confidence thresholding
```

#### 5.2 Ensemble Methods for Short Texts
```python
# Multi-model approach
- Train specialist model on short texts only
- Combine predictions: general model + short text specialist
- Use confidence-based model selection
- Implement voting mechanism for ambiguous cases
```
