# 🚀 Production Training Guide - Khmer OCR Seq2Seq

## ✅ System Status: READY FOR PRODUCTION

Your Khmer OCR system has been **fully verified** and is ready for production training:

- ✅ **PyTorch 2.5.1+cu121** with CUDA support
- ✅ **GPU Support** RTX 3090/4090, A100 (Colab Pro), T4 (Colab Free)
- ✅ **Fixed validation set** (6,400 images) ready
- ✅ **Corpus data** (313,313 training texts) processed
- ✅ **8 Khmer fonts** available for rendering
- ✅ **All training scripts** verified and compatible
- ✅ **EOS/pattern fixes** implemented and tested
- ✅ **Auto-configuration** optimized for different GPU types

## 🎯 Recommended Training Strategy

Based on comprehensive system testing and successful EOS fixes, follow this **two-phase approach**:

### Phase 1: Curriculum EOS Training (1-2 days)
```bash
# Start with curriculum learning to fix EOS generation
python launch_production_training.py curriculum --epochs 20
```

**Why this first:**
- ✅ Fixes EOS generation through progressive sequence length (10→50 chars)
- ✅ Based on successful testing results from TODO completion
- ✅ Forces proper sequence termination learning
- ✅ Optimal batch size 32 auto-selected for RTX 3090

### Phase 2: Full Production Training (5-7 days)
```bash
# Continue with full production training using the best curriculum checkpoint
python launch_production_training.py onthefly --epochs 150 --resume models/checkpoints/curriculum/best.pt
```

**Why this second:**
- ✅ Uses 313K text corpus with unlimited augmentation variety
- ✅ Dynamic image generation (no storage requirements)
- ✅ Fixed validation set ensures consistent evaluation
- ✅ Memory efficient with proven performance

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

### Option 1: Recommended Two-Phase Training
```bash
# Phase 1: Fix EOS generation (20-50 epochs)
python launch_production_training.py curriculum --epochs 20

# Phase 2: Full production training (100+ epochs) 
python launch_production_training.py onthefly --epochs 150 --resume models/checkpoints/curriculum/best.pt
```

### Option 2: Direct On-the-Fly Training
```bash
# Full production training from scratch
python launch_production_training.py onthefly --epochs 150
```

### Option 3: EOS-Focused Training (If needed)
```bash
# Enhanced EOS loss weighting approach
python launch_production_training.py eos-focused --epochs 30
```

### Option 4: Pattern-Fix Training (If needed)
```bash
# Anti-repetition loss approach
python launch_production_training.py pattern-fix --epochs 30
```

## 🔧 Auto-Configuration Features

The launcher automatically configures optimal settings based on your GPU:

**RTX 3090/4090 (24GB):**
- **Batch Size**: 32 (optimal for 24GB VRAM)
- **Memory Usage**: ~8-10GB during training

**A100 40GB (Colab Pro):**
- **Batch Size**: 64 (excellent for fast training)
- **Memory Usage**: ~15-20GB during training

**A100 80GB (Enterprise):**
- **Batch Size**: 96 (maximum performance)
- **Memory Usage**: ~25-30GB during training

**T4 (Colab Free):**
- **Batch Size**: 12 (limited by memory)
- **Memory Usage**: ~10-12GB during training

**Common Features:**
- **Checkpoint Management**: Auto-save with Google Drive backup
- **Validation**: Fixed 6,400 images for consistent evaluation
- **Logging**: TensorBoard integration with progress tracking

## 📱 Google Colab Recommendations

### Colab Pro with A100 (Recommended for Fast Training)
```bash
# Optimal settings for Colab Pro A100
python launch_production_training.py curriculum --epochs 20 --batch-size 64
python launch_production_training.py onthefly --epochs 100 --batch-size 64
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ 2-3x faster training than RTX 3090
- ✅ 40GB VRAM allows larger batch sizes
- ✅ Stable 12+ hour sessions
- ✅ Cost-effective for intensive training

### Colab Free with T4 (Good for Testing)
```bash
# Conservative settings for T4
python launch_production_training.py curriculum --epochs 10 --batch-size 12
```

**Limitations:**
- ⏰ Limited to ~6 hour sessions
- 📊 Smaller batch sizes (slower convergence)
- 💾 Need frequent checkpoint saves

### Colab Setup Tips
1. **Mount Google Drive** for checkpoint persistence
2. **Monitor GPU allocation** - switch to CPU when needed to preserve quota
3. **Use curriculum training first** - shorter epochs, easier to manage
4. **Save checkpoints frequently** - every 5-10 epochs minimum

## 📊 Expected Performance

Based on system testing and architecture verification:

- **Model Parameters**: 19.3M (encoder: 13.1M, decoder: 6.2M)
- **Memory Efficiency**: 0.8MB per batch of 4 images
- **Target CER**: ≤1.0% (Character Error Rate)

**Training Speed (per batch):**
- **RTX 3090**: ~2-3 seconds (batch size 32)
- **A100 40GB**: ~1-2 seconds (batch size 64)
- **A100 80GB**: ~1 second (batch size 96)
- **T4**: ~4-5 seconds (batch size 12)

**Estimated Training Time:**
- **Curriculum (20 epochs)**: 
  - RTX 3090: 1-2 days
  - A100: 12-18 hours
  - T4: 2-3 days
- **Full Production (150 epochs)**:
  - RTX 3090: 5-7 days
  - A100: 3-4 days
  - T4: 10-14 days

# Check system status
python launch_production_training.py --check-only curriculum
```

**EOS Generation Issues:**
```bash
# Use EOS-focused training
python launch_production_training.py eos-focused --epochs 30
```

## 🎯 Success Criteria

Training is successful when you achieve:

1. **EOS Generation**: Model generates proper sequence termination
2. **Low CER**: Validation CER ≤1.0% consistently
3. **No Patterns**: No repetitive character generation
4. **Stable Training**: Loss convergence without divergence
5. **Inference Quality**: Clean text recognition on real images
