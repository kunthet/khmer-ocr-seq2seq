# Change Log

## Feature: Critical Loss Function Fix - LogSoftmax Implementation
**Purpose:**  
Fixed critical mismatch between decoder output and loss function that was causing negative losses and poor model performance. Implemented LogSoftmax output in decoder as specified in PRD to work correctly with NLLLoss.

**Implementation:**  
Resolved fundamental training issue where:
- Decoder was outputting raw logits instead of log probabilities
- Trainer was using NLLLoss which expects log probabilities
- This mismatch caused negative losses and prevented proper learning

Changes made:
- Added LogSoftmax to decoder forward_step method output
- Updated all decoder methods (forward, generate, beam_search) to handle log probabilities
- Updated seq2seq model decode_step to return log probabilities
- Updated trainer comments to reflect log probabilities
- Ensured proper PRD compliance with LogSoftmax + NLLLoss combination

**History:**
- Created — Fixed critical loss function mismatch causing negative losses (-3.8369, -4.2791, etc.) and 116.84% CER. Now properly implements LogSoftmax + NLLLoss as specified in PRD, enabling correct gradient flow and model learning.

## Feature: Google Drive Checkpoint Backup
**Purpose:**  
Automatic backup of training checkpoints to Google Drive for seamless training resumption in Google Colab environments, preventing loss of training progress due to session disconnections.

**Implementation:**  
Enhanced CheckpointManager with Google Drive integration:
- Automatic backup of best models and periodic checkpoints to Google Drive
- Smart fallback loading from Google Drive when local checkpoints are missing
- Training history and metrics backup for complete session recovery
- Colab environment setup script for automated Google Drive mounting and directory creation
- Configurable backup frequency and checkpoint cleanup

**History:**
- Created — Initial implementation with automatic Google Drive backup, fallback loading, training history preservation, and Colab setup automation.

## Feature: Multiple Training Files Support
**Purpose:**  
Support loading training data from multiple files (train_0.txt, train_1.txt, etc.) instead of requiring a single train.txt file, providing flexibility for large datasets and manual data splitting.

**Implementation:**  
Updated data loading mechanisms in OnTheFlyDataset, KhmerCorpusDataset, and KhmerCorpusProcessor to handle multiple training files. The system now:
- Automatically detects and loads multiple training files with pattern train_*.txt
- Falls back to single train.txt if multiple files are not found
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing single-file setups
- Aggregates statistics and line counts across all training files

**History:**
- Created — Initial implementation with automatic detection of multiple training files, fallback to single file, and comprehensive testing verification.

## Feature: [Synthetic Image Generation System]
**Purpose:**  
Implement a pre-generation approach for synthetic images where all training images are generated upfront and organized into train/val/test splits in `data/synthetic/` folder, replacing the previous caching system for better organization and efficiency.

**History:**
- Created — Initial implementation replacing image caching system with pre-generation approach. Organized directory structure with train/val/test splits containing images/, labels/, and metadata.json. Implemented consistent font selection (hash-based for val/test, random for train), augmentation strategies, and comprehensive metadata tracking. Successfully tested with 150 sample images across all splits.
- Updated — Fixed critical font matching bug in `TextRenderer.render_text_pil()` method. The issue was that font paths like `fonts/KhmerOSmuollight.ttf` were not properly matched with loaded PIL font names. Added proper font name extraction and matching logic to ensure correct font selection for rendering.
- Enhanced — Integrated advanced Khmer text processing from imported `khtext` module. Added `khnormal_fast.py` for proper Khmer text normalization, fixing rendering issues with complex Khmer script. Updated `TextRenderer` to use corpus text from `data/processed/` files instead of random text generation. Integrated optional advanced background generation (gradient, noise, paper texture, patterns) while maintaining variable-width images as per project design. All generated images now use properly normalized Khmer text from the corpus with correct font rendering.

## Feature: [Khmer OCR Integrated Synthetic Generator]
**Purpose:**

- Updated — Fixed text cutting issue by removing 1024px width limit in `_calculate_optimal_width()` method, allowing unlimited width to accommodate complete text sequences
- Updated — Fixed height consistency issue in rotated images by modifying `rotate_image()` method to use `expand=True` instead of `expand=False`, and added proper height validation in `_apply_augmentation()` method
- Updated — **ROTATION FIX**: Modified rotation augmentation to preserve content without cropping by using `expand=True` to allow canvas expansion, then shrinking the image to target height while maintaining aspect ratio. This prevents text content from being cut off during rotation augmentation. 

## Feature: [On-the-Fly Training System]

**Implementation:**  
- Standardized font size calculation to 50% of image height (16px for 32px height) across all rendering methods
- Updated 4 locations in `src/data/text_renderer.py`:
  - `render_text_advanced_khmer()` method (line 359)
  - `_render_text_with_background_advanced()` method (line 481)
  - `_load_pil_fonts()` method (lines 151 and 177)
- Added explanatory comments for padding values (50px for basic rendering, 60px for background rendering)
- Fixed comment inconsistencies (updated "80% of height" to "50% of height")

**History:**
- Created — Fixed font size inconsistency where some methods used 80% of height while others used 50%, causing varying text sizes in generated images. Added proper padding comments to explain cropping prevention measures.
